<h1>Raid planner 0.3.0</h1>
	<hr />

	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="inner"><span class="corners-top"><span></span></span></div>
		
		<div class="content">
		<p>What is it ? it's a Calendar and Raidplanner for your phpBB3/bbDKP forum, allowing your members to make and sign up to Events you have set up in bbDKP.</p>
		<p> repository : <a href="https://github.com/bbDKP/Raidplanner">https://github.com/bbDKP/Raidplanner</a> </p>
		
		<p>Forked from Alightner's Calendar mod, modified to work with bbDKP. the base code was refactored into functional classes. Hooks into the bbDKP event and guildmembers Table, so bbDKP 1.2.3 must be installed before.</p>
		<p>It has an MODX & UMIL Database installer. No manual installation necessary.</p>
		
		<p>this release 0.2.3 is still a work in progress, alot of features still need to be added. (Raid confirmations, Subsilver2, recurring raids, ...)</p>
		
		<h2>Raid Feature list</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Raid Events pick up new Raid icons from DKP event. </li>
		<li>Sign up with your Guild characters to raids</li>
		<li>Follow up to which raid(s) you signed up in UCP.</li>
		<li>3 Event types exist : Public events (no signup), Raid events (Signup), and personal events.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Calendar Feature list</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Event View - filled with all event details (who's invited, who created the event, BBCode, Smilies, start and end times, edit & delete buttons if applicable etc) </li>
		<li>Month View - can jump to any month via next and prev links, or jump randomly via pulldown menus. Lists birthdays, event types and event names only. Click on the day's number to add a new event on that day</li>
		<li>Week View - can jump to any week via next and prev links, or jump randomly via pulldown menus. Lists birthdays, event types, names, and times. Click on the day's number to add a new event on that day.</li>
		<li>Day View - can jump to any day via next and prev links, or jump randomly via pulldown menus. Includes a Graphical display of events on a timeline - lets you quickly see schedule conflicts etc. Lists birthdays, event types, names, and times. Click on the day's number to add a new event on that day.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Support for BBCode and Smilies </li>
		<li>Make events bold if you are event creator - Let's you quickly see events most important to you.</li>
		<li>List of Upcoming Events on index - in the ACP you can specify whether or not you want to display the upcoming events on the index (and if so how many events to list). You also have the option to list the current week view on the index.</li>
		<li>Detailed Permissions - You can control who has permission to view, create, edit, delete, and moderate events. </li>
		<li>Auto pruning of past events - From the ACP you control how often events are pruned, and how old they have to be before they are added to the delete list.</li>
		</li>
		
		<li>Ability to invite multiple groups to an event</li>
		
		<li>Custom date/time formatting controlled in calendar ACP - this overwrites the user's preferred
		 date/time format, so you can display just the time in hours where it makes sense (like in the week view) 
		 or the whole date+time (like in the display event)</li>		
		 
		<li>Ability to display events only on their start date - obviously the day view is a graphical display of 
		 all things going on, and events will display in the day view even if not on the start date with this
		  setting turned on. However it's great for things like a week view with an event that starts at
		   10pm and ends at 2am the next day, because it will only display on the first day.</li>																			
		
		<li>New permission option to invite groups you're not a member of - if this is turned on, you'll be able to create events for groups 
		you don't belong to, but the author of the event will always be able to see their own events - even if they don't belong to the invite list.</li>
		
		<li>Detailed permissions for ability to create private, group, or public events - now you can give some users the power to
		 create public events, and others only permission to create private events, or whatever combination makes sense for your forum.</li>
		
		<li>Utility in ACP to move all events +/- one hour (helps when changing forum's dst setting). When you create an event 
		it's stored in an absolute time, and if the forum (and/or users) change their dst settings they may suddenly
		 see all the events appear off by one hour, now there's a utility to move ALL events in the calendar forward or
		  back by one hour to help correct things when you change your DST.</li>
		
		<li>UCP module that displays upcoming events (that the user has registered for) for the next X days.</li>
